jcns_drivers.py
---------------
Driver-namespace function backing the generated drivers.

Blender hard-caps `Driver.expression` at 255 characters: assigning anything
longer silently truncates it, which produces an unbalanced-parenthesis
SyntaxError the moment the driver evaluates.  A single three-point mapping
already costs ~170 characters inline, so two sources on one channel overflow —
and shipped files contain channels with up to eight.

So the expression no longer carries the maths.  It reduces to a call:

    jcns_ch("Armature|L_Dress_HJ_01|Rotation|Z", var, var_001)

which stays well under the cap for any number of sources.  The anchors live in
_CHANNELS, keyed by channel, and the actual dependency on the source bones is
still declared through real driver variables so the depsgraph updates correctly.

Values in _CHANNELS are pre-converted to the driver's own units (radians for
rotation), so the function does no unit conversion.

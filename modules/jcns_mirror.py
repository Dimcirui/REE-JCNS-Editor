--------------
Mirror a constraint mapping from one side of a rig to the other.

A mirrored pair relates as

    f_R(x) = out_sign * f_L(in_sign * x)

and both signs come from the two bones' local frames, read off the armature.
A reflection reverses handedness, so a rotation of +t about a world axis u
becomes -t about M*u: if the right bone's local axis equals +M*u the mirrored
angle is -t, and if it equals -M*u the two negations cancel.  Measured against
an unmodified game skeleton this predicts the SOURCE sign for 80 of 80 pairs.

The output side additionally depends on WHAT is being driven:

  rotation      a pseudovector — mirrors as sigma says
  translation   an ordinary vector — mirrors the opposite way, so -sigma
                (reflecting across x=0 negates a position's X while leaving
                 Y and Z alone; a rotation about X survives and Y/Z flip)
  scale, blend  multiplicative or 0..1, neutral value 1.0 — never negated

flags_cns bit 5 turns out to be exactly the rotation/not-rotation distinction:
across 19884 shipped constraints it is set for Rotation / SwingTwist /
UnkRotation_* and clear for Translation / Scale / BlendShape / Material_*,
agreeing with the transform type 99.6% of the time.  An earlier version of this
module treated it as an opaque "shipped file convention" flag; both descriptions
reproduce the same 6271 of 7451 shipped pairs, but only the vector/pseudovector
reading explains why, and it needs no unexplained bit.

Caveats worth keeping in view:
  * sigma was measured on two skeletons, both giving X:+1, Y:-1, Z:-1 for
    rotations.  Other character rigs may differ, which is why the caller passes
    measured values in rather than trusting the default.
  * roughly one shipped pair in six still does not match, mostly differing in
    magnitude rather than sign — that is deliberate asymmetric authoring and
    must not be overwritten silently.

No `bpy` import, so the rule stays testable without Blender.

    the source and target bones; SIGMA_DEFAULT is used where they are missing.
    Returns (None, None) when either axis has no usable sign.

    `mirror_in` / `mirror_out` say whether the source side / target side is
    actually being reflected to a different bone at all. A constraint can be
    "mirrored" on only one side — e.g. a centre-line bone (no L/R pair) driven
    independently from both thighs: the target stays put and only the source
    flips L_Thigh -> R_Thigh. The side that is not flipping keeps its value
    as-is (sign +1); the vector/pseudovector distinction below only matters
    where a reflection is actually happening, so it is skipped entirely for a
    fixed side rather than defaulting to SIGMA_DEFAULT (which describes a real
    mirror pair, not "unchanged").

    sigma_from_frames() reports the PSEUDOVECTOR sign, which is what a rotation
    follows.  A position is an ordinary vector and mirrors the other way round —
    reflecting across x=0 negates a position's X component while leaving Y and Z
    alone, whereas a rotation about X survives and Y/Z flip.  The two are exact
    negatives of one another, so a translation output simply takes -sigma.

    This is what an earlier version of this module mistook for a "shipped file
    convention" governed by flags_cns bit 5.  Both descriptions score identically
    (6271 of 7451 pairs), because the bit merely tracks the transform type — but
    only this one explains *why*.

    The same applies to the input: `source_quantity` is what the source reads
    (+25, see jcns_mapping.source_quantity).  A translation source flips
    opposite to sigma and a scale source never flips.  Checked against the
    shipped L/R pairs of MH Wilds with sigma measured from each mesh's bind
    pose: translation sources reproduce 117 of 152 (23 when read as rotations),
    scale sources 186 of 186 (62).  With SIGMA_DEFAULT instead of measured
    frames translation sources do worse, because the helper bones they are
    mostly read from do not share the main skeleton's frames.

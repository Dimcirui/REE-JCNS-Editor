-------------
What the bits of ConstraintInfo's `flags_cns` mean, and which of them follow
from the transform type.

Derived from 19884 constraints in 884 shipped v102 files.  Two bits turn out to
be a pure function of TransformationID — every one of the 15 observed types uses
a single value, with no exceptions at all:

    bit 4   the constraint drives a BONE rather than a material / blend weight
            set for Translation, Rotation, Scale, SwingTwist, TwistSwing,
            RotationVector, AxisRotation/14; clear for Material_*, BlendShape,
            Scalar, Unknown_12.
            (the bt template guesses "isJoint?" — this confirms it)

    bit 5   the driven quantity is angular
            set for Rotation, SwingTwist, TwistSwing, RotationVector,
            AxisRotation/14; clear for Translation, Scale, BlendShape,
            Material_*, Scalar, Unknown_12.
            (unnamed in the bt template)

Because they are redundant with the transform type, the exporter recomputes them
instead of trusting whatever is sitting in the raw field — otherwise changing a
constraint's transform type in the UI would leave the flags describing the old
one, and nothing would complain.

bit 0 is NOT derivable: it varies within a single type (Rotation appears as both
49 and 48), so it is a genuine per-constraint setting and is left alone.  The bt
template guesses "isAdd?".

The rule holds for every constraint of v36 (Onimusha, 3596) and v102 (22839),
but not for RE9's v35: 1149 of 2349 disagree, almost all AxisRotation/14 with
bit 5 clear.  Only DERIVED_BITS_VERSIONS get the bits rewritten; older files
have no Flags byte at all.

No `bpy` import, so this stays testable without Blender.
